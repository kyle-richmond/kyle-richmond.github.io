  <strong>Cohort component population estimates for Ireland, 1911–1920: a new county-level dataset for use in historical demography</strong><br>

      This article introduces the new dataset Cohort Component Population Estimates for Ireland, 1911–1920 <a href="https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855572/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855572/)</a>. 
      The dataset provides vital statistics and cohort component population estimates at a spatially-disaggregated level for the island of Ireland for the period 1911–1920. 
      The raw data were digitised by the authors using official UK government statistics. The population estimates were then derived by the cohort component method. 
      These data provide novel intercensal population estimates at the county level that will be beneficial for researchers working in historical demography, as well as in economic and social history. 
      The data provided can be readily reused and extended by other researchers to produce further series and indicators. 
      An example application of the data in this manner is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2021.100984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Colvin and McLaughlin (2021)</a>, who combine these population estimates with mortality statistics from the Spanish flu pandemic to demonstrate how demographic composition affects the interpretation of data on public health crises.

  <strong>Big Tobacco: Strategy, Structure, and Competition Policy in the Post-War British Cigarette Market</strong><br>

      Taking the domestic cigarette market as a representative case, this paper examines how the introduction of anti-collusion legislation affected firm strategic behaviour and market structures in the UK. 
      Using newly digitized evidence on prices and advertising alongside unpublished archival sources, it shows that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act (1956) eliminated formal cartel agreements but did not lead to meaningful price competition. 
      Producers instead shifted toward implicit coordination, intensified non-price rivalry through advertising and promotional expenditure, and undertook compensatory acquisitions.  
      Moreover, weak institutional oversight blunted the deterrent effect of regulatory scrutiny.  
      The analysis demonstrates how incumbents adapted to the regulatory environment and maintained their dominance over the competitive fringe, highlighting the limitations of Britain’s mid-century institutional framework for governing anticompetitive conduct.

  <strong>Arranged Marriage: Mergers as Industrial Policy in Britain, 1966–70</strong><br>

    <p>
      How does competition affect innovation and firm performance? In the 1960s, the British government pursued an experiment in merger-led industrial policy through the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (IRC). 
      Archival evidence shows policymakers embraced a "Schumpeterian" belief that larger firms would be more innovative, and sought to accelerate industrial rationalization by promoting consolidation in strategically important and technologically advanced sectors. 
      Crucially, IRC sponsorship conferred a regulatory privilege: backed mergers were insulated from scrutiny by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, providing a guaranteed escape from investigation under the Monopolies and Mergers Act of 1965. 
      Using firm-level quality-adjusted patent stocks, financial accounts, and daily stock-market data, I evaluate the effects of IRC-sponsored mergers on innovation, operating performance, and shareholder returns. 
      The results show declining innovative output, no improvement in operating performance relative to peers, and short-run abnormal stock returns concentrated in targets. 
      These findings indicate that government-backed consolidation primarily enabled firms to bypass competition law and entrench incumbent power, rather than fostering technological dynamism or productivity growth.

  <strong>Innovation and Market Structure in Post-War British Manufacturing</strong><br>

      This paper analyses how market concentration and competitive pressure influenced innovation across British manufacturing in the post-war period. 
      Drawing on data from industry-level R&D expenditure and firm-level patent activity, it tests theories that relate concentration to innovative performance, including Schumpeterian and “escape competition” dynamics. 
      The findings indicate that innovation is highest at intermediate levels of concentration, providing evidence of an inverted-U relationship between market power and inventive output. 
      In markets characterized by high concentration and entrenched incumbents, innovation intensity weakens, while moderate competitive rivalry stimulates greater technological effort. 
      These results refine the empirical understanding of the competition–innovation nexus and help explain the broader stagnation of inventive activity in post-war Britain. 
      The study underscores that the structure of product markets—and the policies shaping them—had meaningful consequences for national innovative capacity.
