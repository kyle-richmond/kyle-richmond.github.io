      This article introduces the new dataset Cohort Component Population Estimates for Ireland, 1911–1920 <a href="https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855572/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855572/)</a>. 
      The dataset provides vital statistics and cohort component population estimates at a spatially-disaggregated level for the island of Ireland for the period 1911–1920. 
      The raw data were digitised by the authors using official UK government statistics. The population estimates were then derived by the cohort component method. 
      These data provide novel intercensal population estimates at the county level that will be beneficial for researchers working in historical demography, as well as in economic and social history. 
      The data provided can be readily reused and extended by other researchers to produce further series and indicators. 
      An example application of the data in this manner is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2021.100984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Colvin and McLaughlin (2021)</a>, who combine these population estimates with mortality statistics from the Spanish flu pandemic to demonstrate how demographic composition affects the interpretation of data on public health crises.

  <strong>Big Tobacco: Strategy, Structure, and Competition Policy in the Post-War British Cigarette Market</strong><br>
  <!--[targeted at <em>Business History</em>, planned submission in January 2026]  -->

    <p>
      Taking the domestic cigarette market as a representative case, this paper examines how the introduction of anti-collusion legislation affected firm strategic behaviour and market structures in the UK. 
      Using newly digitized evidence on prices and advertising alongside unpublished archival sources, it shows that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act (1956) eliminated formal cartel agreements but did not lead to meaningful price competition. 
      Producers instead shifted toward implicit coordination, intensified non-price rivalry through advertising and promotional expenditure, and undertook compensatory acquisitions.  
      Moreover, weak institutional oversight blunted the deterrent effect of regulatory scrutiny.  
      The analysis demonstrates how dominant incumbents adapted to the regulatory environment and maintained their dominance over the competitive fringe, highlighting the limitations of Britain’s mid-century institutional framework for governing anticompetitive conduct.

  <strong>Arranged Marriage: Mergers as Industrial Policy in Britain, 1966–70</strong><br>
  <!-- [targeted at <em>The Economic History Review</em>, planned submission in Summer 2026] -->

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>
      This paper evaluates the effects of government-advocated industrial consolidation in Britain during the late 1960s. 
      Advocates of the policy, influenced by contemporary economic thinking regarding the innovative capacity of large firms, believed that scale-enhancing mergers would spur technological dynamism and improve industrial performance. 
      Using a combination of archival evidence, quality-adjusted patent stock data, difference-in-differences analysis, and stock-market event studies, this research finds no significant improvement in innovation, operating performance, or shareholder value for firms involved in state-encouraged mergers. 
      Instead, consolidation operated primarily as an administrative expansion of corporate structure rather than a catalyst for innovative capability. 
      These results suggest that merger-led industrial policy was grounded more in ideological conviction than empirical validity and that its implementation exacerbated the problem of entrenched corporate dominance rather than alleviating it.

  <strong>Innovation and Market Structure in Post-War British Manufacturing</strong><br>
  <!-- [targeted at <em>RAND Journal of Economics</em>] -->
  [<a href="LINK-TO-DRAFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link to latest draft</a>]<br>
   <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>
      This paper analyses how market concentration and competitive pressure influenced innovation across British manufacturing in the post-war period. 
      Drawing on data from industry-level R&D expenditure and firm-level patent activity, it tests theories that relate concentration to innovative performance, including Schumpeterian and “escape competition” dynamics. 
      The findings indicate that innovation is highest at intermediate levels of concentration, providing evidence of an inverted-U relationship between market power and inventive output. 
      In markets characterized by high concentration and entrenched incumbents, innovation intensity weakens, while moderate competitive rivalry stimulates greater technological effort. 
      These results refine the empirical understanding of the competition–innovation nexus and help explain the broader stagnation of inventive activity in post-war Britain. 
      The study underscores that the structure of product markets—and the policies shaping them—had meaningful consequences for national innovative capacity.
